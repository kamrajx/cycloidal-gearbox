# cycloidal-gearbox
Open-source cycloidal gearbox for robotic applications, designed for 3D printing and off-the-shelf components.

## About This Project  
This project, **"Design and Fabrication of Cycloidal Gearbox"**, was developed as part of the final year (2024-25) engineering curriculum by the Mechanical Engineering Department, **Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering**, Bangalore.  

Now, before we get too excited, here's the *honest truth*—our original project title was *"Design and Fabrication of Robotic Actuator."* Sounds fancy, right? But what we actually ended up with is a *Cycloidal Gearbox.* Yeah, we know, pretty big switch. It's like walking into a bakery expecting donuts and leaving with a cake… but hey, it works, and it’s awesome! So, we decided to roll with it and hope you enjoy the result!

The goal was to create an affordable, compact, and efficient cycloidal gearbox for robotic applications using 3D printing and off-the-shelf components. A *bit of a detour* from the robotic actuator idea, but trust us, this gear reduction system is going to be a game-changer for any robot.

## Features  
- **High Torque:** Gear ratio of 40:1.  
- **Compact and Lightweight:** Perfect for 3D printing with PLA Pro.  
- **Open Source:** Licensed under CERN Open Hardware License v2.0 (Strongly Reciprocal).  

## Files  
- `/designs`: CAD files (SolidWorks).  
- `/stl`: STL files for 3D printing. **Note:** These files are in actual size. You may need to modify them using the provided CAD files to fit your printer's capabilities or specific requirements.  
- `/bom`: Bill of Materials (BOM).  
- `/docs`: Assembly guides and other documentation.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository (or, y'know, just steal it—we’re cool with that).  
2. Use the CAD or STL files to manufacture the gearbox (unless you’re a wizard and can just *wish* it into existence).  
3. Adjust STL files in CAD software if necessary for your specific 3D printer.  
4. Follow the documentation for assembly and testing (it’s not rocket science, but we’ve made it as simple as we could).
